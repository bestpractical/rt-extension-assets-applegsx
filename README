NAME
    RT-Extension-Assets-AppleGSX - Apple GSX for RT Assets

INSTALLATION
    perl Makefile.PL
    make
    make install
        May need root permissions

    make initdb
        Only run this the first time you install this module; this will
        create several custom fields for assets. If you already have custom
        fields for serial numbers and warantee information, this step is
        unnecessary.

        Running "make initdb" twice will cause duplicate custom fields.

    Edit your /opt/rt4/etc/RT_SiteConfig.pm
        Add this line:

            Set(@Plugins, qw(RT::Extension::Assets::AppleGSX));

        or add "RT::Extension::Assets::AppleGSX" to your existing @Plugins
        line.

    Add configuration options to "RT_SiteConfig.pm"
        See CONFIGURATION below for options.

    Run
    /opt/rt4-assets/local/plugins/RT-Extension-Assets-AppleGSX/bin/rt-apple-
    gsx-set-warranty
        You will likely wish to configure this script to run regularly, via
        a cron job.

CONFIGURATION
    To connect to Apple's GSX service, you must first contact Apple to
    create an account. Once you have an account with a user ID and service
    account number, you must then get certificate and key files from Apple
    and your server IP addresses must be whitelisted by Apple.

    Once you have done this, you can configure the authentication
    information used to connect to GSX via the web UI, at Tools ->
    Configuration -> Assets -> Apple GSX. This menu option is only available
    to SuperUsers. Depending on the services you are using, the RT webserver
    user and the user running any cron jobs will need read access to the
    certificate and key files on your server.

    Additionally, if you are not using the supplied custom fields, you may
    wish to Set one or more of the following in your RT_SiteConfig.pm (their
    defaults are shown):

        # Name of custom field containing serial number
        Set( $AppleGSXSerialCF => "Serial Number" )

        # CFs to import from GSX, and their names there
        Set( %AppleGSXMap,
            'Warranty Status'     => 'warrantyStatus',
            'Warranty Start Date' => 'coverageStartDate',
            'Warranty End Date'   => 'coverageEndDate',
        );

        # Only attempt to import data from GSX for assets matching the
        # following CF values:
        Set( %AppleGSXChecks,
            'Trademark' => qr/\bApple(Care)?\b/i,
        );
